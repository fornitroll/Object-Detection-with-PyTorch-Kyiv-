        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The difference here is very similar to the difference between dynamic and static programming languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Static Graph:\n",
        "\n",
        "Is consists of two steps. First declaring graph by setting input/output shapes of tensors, operations, etc. Second is execution when you push your data through all graph elements to get the result.\n",
        "\n",
        "That's why for example in TF always exist problems with shapes. Because before running you can get only static shapes, and thus it can make code of the models much harder to read cause you need to use hacks to implement some architectures. In TF2.0(beta) this become even more problematic(and thats, why I moved to PyTorch at that time, because spent time on fight with framework instead of doing work, is not the best plan)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pros:**\n",
        "* Static graph gives more ways to optimize the inference\n",
        "* Static graph can be implemented in hardware or even [optics](http://www.computationalimaging.org/publications/hybrid-optical-electronic-convolutional-neural-networks/)\n",
        "* They are faster(but not always)\n",
        "* It much simpler to distribute graph on many machines (one of the reasons why PyTorch has problems with running on TPU)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cons:**\n",
        "* The main purpose of it is fast and distributed inference, but when it comes to development it becomes much harder to build and debug the code.\n",
        "* In most cases code is much cleaner\n",
        "* Some architecture is to complicated when built using a static graph.\n",
        "* It's impossible to have dynamic size Input/Output in RNNs (Before TF2.0, TF was used [Tensorflow Fold](https://github.com/tensorflow/fold) to handle this)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Dynamic Graph:\n",
        "\n",
        "Do what you want and whenever you want. And this opens very big possibilities in developing bizarre algorithms and architectures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pros/Cons - just reverse Pros/Cons of static graph :)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "So I would say like this: Static graphs are more for ML Engineers whose main tasks are speed and distribution. And Dynamic graphs are more for ML researches who need simple implementation and debug\n"
